Pokemon Battles have a type game which is similar to Rock - Paper - Scissors

Every Pokemon can have upto 2 types.
Every Pokemon attack can have exactly one type.

Rules of the Rock Paper Scissors
1. If a pokemon uses an attack of any of it's 1-2 types it gets +50% damage, otherwise it deals +0% damage..
Example 1: Mew 
Mew is only Psychic type pokemon.
-Any attack of Psychic type will get +50% damage from Mew.
-Any Non Psychic attack by Mew will get +0% damage.

Example 2: Scizor 
Scizor is Bug + Steel type. Scizor is evolution of Scyther.
- Any attack of Bug type will deal +50% damage from Scizor.
- Any attack of Steel type will deal +50% damage when used by Scizor.
- Any attack not of Bug or Steel type will deal +0% damage by Scizor.

2. Given a type chart, the outcome of the Rock - Paper - Scissors is determined by the type chart.
The outcomes of an attack based on type chart rock paper scissors is
- Super Effective - deals double damage.
- Not very effective - deals half damage.
- Immune - deals no damage.
- Normal - neither effective or ineffective - deals regular damage without increase or reduction - assume this to be default unless specified otherwise.

Example 3: Scyther

- Dragon type is Super Effective against, Not very effective against, immune to none.
- Flying type is Super Effective against, Not very effective against, immune to .
- types are Super Effective against Dragon type.
- types are Super Effective against Flying type.

Dragonite takes damage logic
X Pokemon attacks Dragonite.
The pokemon has 4 moves
-
-
-
-

If X uses Y type attack it will be super effective against dragonite. Calculation is:
-

If X uses Z type attack it will not be very effective against dragonite. Calculation is:
-


3. IV attribute stats also influence damage
Apart from the type chart
- the level difference between pokemon also affect the damage.
- The Special attack stat(XATTACK) of attacker pokemon increases damage of attacks as a multiplier equation.
- The Special defence stat(XDEFENCE) of defender pokemon decreases damage taken by attack as a multiplier equation.
- The speed attribute state determines who attacks first, except for an attack named Quick attack.

5. After the code is done

Test for bugs using hidden examples to test for code reliability 

Expand type chart from 5 x 5 to 17 x 17 type chart.
The 17 types are - 

Example 5: Gyarados

Example 6: ElectaBuzz

Example 7: Typlosion

Example 8: Geodude

Example 9: Haunter

Example 10: Aerodactyl

Change the examples to keep the hidden test not easy to guess in advance.


One of best pokemon deck of 6 pokemon is (due to IV stats + type advantages)
- Khangaskhan
- Gyarados
- Lavitar
- Golem
- Electrode - self destruct
- Rhydon
